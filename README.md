## üìò Overview
This portfolio documents my learning journey through the ITAI 2376 Deep Learning course at Houston Community College. Each module provided new concepts, hands-on labs, and real-world tools used in artificial intelligence. Below is a summary of what I learned from each module and supporting assignments, visuals, and screenshots.

## ‚úÖ Module Summaries

### Module 01: Deep Learning  
I learned that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broad field for intelligent machines, Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield that helps them learn from data, and Deep Learning is a further subfield that uses layered neural networks to find patterns. I also learned important terms like neurons, activation functions, backpropagation, and loss functions.

### Module 02: DL Environments, Libraries, and Tools  
I explored the tools needed for deep learning, comparing cloud platforms like Google Colab and AWS with local setups. I learned about popular frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. I also included a screenshot from a previous assignment comparing TensorFlow and Python in real-world use.

### Module 03: Neural Network Basics  
I learned how basic neural networks work using artificial neurons, layers, weights, and backpropagation. I included a screenshot of my ‚ÄúTurtle Transformer‚Äù neural network animal project and explained its real-world potential.

### Module 04: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
This module focused on image classification using CNNs. I studied filters, pooling, and convolutional layers. I also practiced explaining CNNs in simple terms.

### Module 05: Sequence Modeling and NLP with RNNs  
I explored how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) process sequences like text and speech. These models are essential in natural language processing (NLP).

### Module 06: Transformers and Attention  
Transformers use attention mechanisms to analyze sequences better than RNNs. They are the backbone of today‚Äôs NLP and vision models.

### Module 07: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  
I learned how VAEs compress and generate data by working in a latent space. They allow flexible reconstructions and creative outputs.

### Module 08: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  
GANs use two networks‚Äîa generator and a discriminator‚Äîthat compete to create realistic synthetic data. They‚Äôre widely used in media and design.

### Module 09: Diffusion Models  
These models generate content by gradually removing noise. I learned how they differ from GANs and VAEs in training stability and quality.

### Module 10: Reinforcement Learning  
Agents learn by interacting with environments and getting rewards. I explored value functions, policies, and how agents adapt through trial and error.

### Module 11: RAG and Reasoning Models  
I explored retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where external memory helps large models answer questions more accurately.

### Module 12: Agent Planning and Orchestration  
I learned how agents use workflows and memory to plan tasks, manage long-term goals, and act independently.

### Module 13: AI Agents  
In this module, I learned how AI agents use memory, logic, and prompts to complete tasks. They can work on their own and adapt to changes.

### Module 14: Multi-Agent Systems  
I studied how multiple AI agents communicate and coordinate in shared environments, such as robotics, simulations, and large-scale systems.
