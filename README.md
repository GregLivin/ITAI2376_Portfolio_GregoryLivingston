# ITAI2376 Deep Learning Portfolio – Gregory Livingston

Welcome to my final portfolio for the ITAI 2376: Deep Learning course. This repository showcases the knowledge, skills, and projects I developed throughout the semester.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `Module_01_Intro/` – Overview of deep learning, course setup, initial reflections
- `Module_02_Neural_Networks/` – Core concepts of neural networks, forward/backward propagation
- `Module_03_Optimizers/` – Comparative analysis of optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
- `Module_04_CNNs/` – Convolutional neural networks and their application to image data
- `Final_Project/` – Complete prototype: AI Personal Wellness Coach (RAG-based assistant)

## 🧠 Course Summary

This course covered:
- Deep learning foundations and architecture
- Neural networks and training processes
- Optimizers and their performance
- CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers
- Final project: AI system using modern architectures

## 🚀 Final Project

The **AI Personal Wellness Coach** helps users manage their physical and mental health using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector search. It pulls from a knowledge base to answer questions, monitor mood, and give support in real time.

✅ Includes:
- Code
- Data pipeline
- Report
- Screenshots
- Prototype demo
