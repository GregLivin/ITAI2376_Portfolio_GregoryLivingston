# Deep Learning Portfolio – ITAI 2376 | Your Name

Welcome to my deep learning portfolio for the ITAI 2376 course. This repository documents my progress through all 14 modules of the course. Inside, you'll find presentation files, assignments, code notebooks, and reflections that demonstrate what I’ve learned.

## 📘 Modules Overview

### 🔹 Module 01: Course Introduction
Introduced the foundations of deep learning and how it fits within the field of artificial intelligence. Covered what to expect throughout the course.

### 🔹 Module 02: Environments & Tools
Explored popular programming languages and frameworks for deep learning, such as Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I compared using a local machine versus cloud platforms (like Google Colab and AWS) for training deep learning models.

### 🔹 Module 03: Neural Networks
Learned how neural networks are structured using layers, weights, biases, and activation functions. Practiced training networks using backpropagation and optimization techniques.

### 🔹 Module 04: Convolutional Neural Networks
Focused on image processing tasks using CNNs. Gained experience with filters, pooling layers, and how CNNs learn to recognize visual patterns.

### 🔹 Module 05: Sequence Modeling and NLP
Studied recurrent networks and how they are used in natural language tasks. Worked with sequences, word embeddings, and LSTM layers.

### 🔹 Module 06: Transformers & Attention
Examined how attention mechanisms improve performance in sequence tasks. Learned the architecture behind modern transformer models used in NLP and computer vision.

### 🔹 Module 07: Autoencoders and VAEs
Looked at how autoencoders compress and reconstruct input data. Learned how variational autoencoders introduce randomness to generate new examples.

### 🔹 Module 08: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Explored the interaction between generator and discriminator networks. Reviewed how GANs are used in deepfake creation and image generation.

### 🔹 Module 09: Diffusion Models
Learned about a newer generation of generative models that work through iterative denoising. Implemented sampling using a U-Net structure.

### 🔹 Module 10: Reinforcement Learning
Studied the behavior of learning agents interacting with environments. Applied concepts like rewards, policies, and value estimation.

### 🔹 Module 11: Reasoning Models and RAG
Focused on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and reasoning using large language models. Discussed how to make LLMs more reliable in generating answers.

### 🔹 Module 12: Agent Planning and Orchestration
Studied how to create multi-step agents that use memory and decision-making to plan over time. Covered orchestration in multi-agent systems.

### 🔹 Module 13: AI Agents in Action
Implemented an AI agent using a provided notebook. This module connected all previous lessons by bringing together reasoning, memory, and planning.

### 🔹 Module 14: Multi-Agent Systems
Discussed scaling and coordination between multiple agents. Covered system design considerations for collaborative AI.
